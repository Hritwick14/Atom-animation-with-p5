# Atom-animation-with-p5

This is a project just for testing my graphical skills on p5js.
P5js is a fantastic library for any kind of graphical project or content, and one of my favourite javascript libraries.
It has awesome documentation and good suggestion and helping snippets from its community too. By the way the idea for this came to mind when studying about elasticity in Physics, and combining that with the concept of Object Oriented Programming.
